<p>If you haven’t already realized, my name is Jake Carlyle, and this is my personal website. If you are here you are likely a friend or family member, a prospective employer, a prospective client, or someone who loves to travel. 
In any case I am thrilled to have you here, and I would love to use this as an opportunity for you to get to know me further. The goal of this website is for every visitor to get a feel for who I am as a person, and give them a peek at my life journey. 
I have seen a good chunk of the world, and I love to share my experiences with those that are interested. The <a href="Blog.html">blog<a/> section of the website will be mixed bag of topics, but it will mostly be about my travel experiences. 
Hopefully reading about what is out there will give you some inspiration to take that trip you've been planning in your head for the last 5 years. 
Any suggestions or links will <b>not</b> be affiliate links, and I gain no benefit or commissions if you follow them. I just want to help put you in the right direction of some of the cool things Earth has to offer. </p>
<p> I started this website in January 2020 with absolutely zero knowledge of HTML, CSS, or Javascript. Through more than a few hours of trial and error, I cobbled together enough command of these languages to come up with a finished product that I am quite proud of presenting to you. ALl the code for the site is stored on a GitHub repository, and hosted through GitHub pages. 
It was important for me to learn how to go through the entire website building process from scratch, because I love learning something new. I wanted to be able to say that I started with zero knowledge of how do to any of this, and now by the end I can say that I wrote the code, designed everything, found a host, and procured a domain name all on my own. 
Like I have said already, I am quite proud of what you are looking at right now, however, the mobile version of the site is still a work in progress. If you are looking at this on your phone things may look a bit wonky for the time being, but keep checking back for the latest progress on mobile, I am hoping to have it done soon! </p>
<p> Please have a look around to get a better idea of who I am, where I have worked, what kind of work I have done, and where in the world I have traveled. If you are interested in discussing an open position, would like to discuss working together on a certain project, or need some awesome travel tips, please visit the <a href="ContactMe.html">contact page<a/>. I hope to hear from you soon, and in the meantime stay safe and look out for your fellow neighbors.</p>
