<h1> Let me tell you a little about myself. </h1>

<center><h2 style="font-size:25px;font-family:'Raleway'"><u><b>About Me</u></b></h2></center>
<center><div class="values">
<p>Growing up in a small town with a population of about 1,100 people, living the life I have lived thus far was never in the realm of possibilities. For almost a decade of my early life I lived on a farm in this small town, surrounded by open fields, cows, horses, and the occasional peacock (yes you read that right, one of our Amish neighbors owned peacock). That period of my life, along with working demanding summer jobs in a local cabinet shop and at a local landscaping company, ingrained a set of values that I am proud to carry with me today.
<br>
<br>
The exciting details of my education and work experience can be found in detail on the “Résumé” page above, but I believe some details are important to include here to get a full picture of who I am as a person. I graduated from Indiana University in 2017 with a B.S. in Sport Management. My time at Indiana University was an immensely important part of my life. Not only is this where I discovered my ability to connect with people while cold calling in the athletic ticket office, it is also where I discovered my affinity and skill for marketing and building a marketing plan through a creative process. I greatly credit that discovery to one of my favorite professors at IU, Ann Bastianelli. Perhaps the greatest highlight of my college years, and the one that changed my life in the best way possible, was meeting my wife. The last two things I listed changed the course of my life, for the best. My wife’s job has allowed us to live in Europe the last three years, and quite frankly has enabled us to live an incredibly unique life that I am very thankful for. 
<br>
<br>
The last three years have been an amazing, indescribable time of my life. I have traveled to 35 countries and 3 continents, I have learned how to live with uncertainty, I have learned so many things about so many different cultures that have opened my mind in so many different ways, and most importantly I have learned how to live outside of my comfort zone and adapt to unfamiliarity on the fly. 
<br>
<br>
In my free time I enjoy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sitting down and reading a good book </li>
<li>Taking a hike in nature with my wife and our dog, Ruthie </li>
<li>Watching any sporting event I can get my eyes on </li>
<li>Going for a long run (currently training for a 10k) </li>
<li>Cooking up a new recipe </li>
<li>Spending time with family and friends </li>
</ul>

<p>At the moment I am an unrestricted free agent and am seeking employment in the marketing and creative industry in the Oklahoma City area. I have spent the last couple of years fine tuning my skills, and I believe I am in a great position to be an exceptional addition to an already great team. I look forward to hearing from you soon!

<center><h2 style="font-size:25px;font-family:'Raleway'"><u><b>Core Values</u></b></h2></center>

<div class="valuesquote"><p> "When you are led by values, it doesn’t cost your business, it helps your business.” <center><p>- Jerry Greenfield<center></p></div>
<center><div class="values">
<ul>
        <li><b><u>Treat others with respect and empathy</u></b>: Be nice to people, it’s not that hard.</li>
	<li><b><u>Prioritize mental and physical health</u></b>: The best work comes when you are your best self.</li>
	<li><b><u>Be humble</u></b>: I am never too good to learn something new.</li>
	<li><b><u>Integrity</u></b>: Do the right thing, and if I mess up, I will own up to it.</li>
	<li><b><u>Value diversity and inclusion</u></b>: The best ideas come from a room of people with completely different backgrounds, and entirely different life experiences. </li>
	<li><b><u>Sustainability in the environment</u></b>: There is too much beauty in the world to allow it to be ruined by our actions.</li>
	<li><b><u>Desire to win</u></b>: Nobody wants to lose, but not everybody has a burning desire to compete and to win.</li>
	<li><b><u>Faith</u></b>: “Don’t worry. God is always on time. Trust him.”</li>
	<li><b><u>Live passionately</u></b>: Everybody has a passion in life, and you’re not living your life to the fullest if you’re not pursuing it.</li>
	<li><b><u>Be genuine and sincere</u></b>: “Be who you are and say what you feel. Those who mind don’t matter, and those who matter don’t mind” </li>
	<li><b><u>Family</u></b>: Whether it is your family, your work family, or whatever you choose to call family, nobody will give you a better support system and have your back like family does.  </li>
      </ul></div></center>
