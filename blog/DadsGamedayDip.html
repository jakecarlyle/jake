<h1>Dad’s Gameday Cheese Dip</h1>
<h2 style="font-size:17px;">Every gameday needs a dip, and this has been the go-to dip for my family since I can remember.</h2>

<p>This is a particularly difficult post to write, but it is one that I know my dad would be happy and so excited that I did. In May of this year my dad passed away. I’m writing this in September, and I can say it has been four of the most difficult months of my life. He didn’t even get to see all the work that I put into this website and the finished product; it’s something I know he would’ve been very proud of me for. Now, this post isn’t entirely about that, that is an entire post in itself, but this post is about one of my favorite memories that I have of my dad. Every year since I can remember my dad usually fired up the crockpot and made this dip for the opening weekend of the NFL and usually the Super Bowl. When my brother or I think of football, our minds usually drift to this dip. The NFL kicks off this weekend, so I thought I would honor my dad and share the recipe of this dip that means so much to my brother and me.</p>

<p>I wanted to make this dip for Super Bowl LIV, so I asked my dad if he had the recipe written down anywhere. The last text message I received from my dad was this recipe. He said he had been making this dip from memory for the last 40+ years, but he took the time to transcribe it for me, so I could have it for the rest of my life to pass down. Unfortunately, our commissary was inexplicably out of Velveeta cheese, so when I called him the night of the Super Bowl, he was a bit bummed out that I didn’t get to make his dip. So, on this NFL kickoff weekend I am firing up the crockpot, and I am going to hang out with my dad, watch his favorite team, the Lions, lose, and eat this dip until I no longer have an appetite. </p>

		<center><h2>Dad’s Gameday Cheese Dip</h2></center>
<ul>
<li>1 2-pound brick of Velveeta cheese</li>

<li>1 can of Rotel Mild Diced Tomatoes w/ Green Chilis</li>
<li>1 jar of favorite salsa (I use Pace Chunky Salsa, Medium heat) </li>
<li>1 or 2 bags of Tostitos Scoops! (my dad loved Scoops! style chips)</li></ul>

<ol>
<li>Fry out sausage until sufficiently cooked and browned</li>
<li>Combine the rest of the ingredients, along with the sausage, into the crockpot </li>
