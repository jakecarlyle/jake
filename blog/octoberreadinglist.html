<p>The “3 to Read” series took a little bit of a break the last two months, but we are back in business with 3 new books to enjoy this October. The last couple of months have been a pretty hectic time in our life. Who knew planning a transatlantic move, with pets, in the middle of a global pandemic would be such a logistical nightmare? Luckily, at the time of writing this post, most fires have been put out, and our move is looking like it will happen as smoothly as you could expect in today’s current environment. Beyond planning for this crazy move, we have managed to take two much needed getaways to Portugal (post coming soon!) and Paris. Laying on a beach in the Algarve and sipping wine and eating a baguette in the park in front of the Eifel Tower can have a therapeutic effect on a person. Unfortunately, due to the circumstances that accompany this pandemic, it looks like our European adventures have come to a close. Thankfully, it will take years for me to run out of places, countries, and trips that we have taken before I run out of things to write about. So, fear not, you can continue to live vicariously through my travels on this website for years to come. </p>
