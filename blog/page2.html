	<h2><a href="../blog/2020fantasyfootballrankings.html">2020 Fantasy Football Rankings and Insights (0.5 PPR)(Updated 9/5)</a></h2>
	<div class="values">
<p>This previous Spring, I had the idea to start my own fantasy football brand. I’m confident in my social media knowhow to springboard a brand from nothing to something that people seek out. I’m also extremely confident in my knowledge of the NFL to give sound advice that people can trust. While some personal events got in the way of my desire and motivation to start that up this spring and summer, it is still in my future plans of something I would like to do. I have had quite a high level of success in fantasy football over the 15 or so years that I have been playing, and I want to share some of the knowledge with people that want to get better. Drafting preparation season is upon us, so I thought it would be a good time to drop my rankings. This is hobby of mine that I like to take on in the fall, so in lieu of starting my own fantasy football website this summer there may be some blog posts on here instead. Always feel free to reach out if you ever have any questions or requests. <a href="../blog/2020fantasyfootballrankings.html"><b>(Continue Reading)</b></a></p></div>

	<div class="values">
	<p>Living with a vegetarian has turned me into more of omnivore than I figured I would ever be in life. Truth be told, my diet has turned to about 80% vegetarian (65% higher than I ever imagined it would). While I now consume more tofu and black beans, taco night is a night that I like to include some meat. Thankfully, I have found a recipe that satisfies both the vegetarian in my wife, and the meat eater in me. In addition to the taco recipe, I wanted to share my salsa recipe that has always gotten rave reviews. I usually do things in this order: <a href="../blog/tacotuesday.html"><b>(Continue Reading)</b></a></p></div>

	<h2><a href="../blog/switzerlandanniversarytrip.html">Third Anniversary in the Swiss Alps</a></h2>
	<div class="values">
	<p>On July 22, 2017 my wife and I were standing on a beach in St. Joseph, Michigan saying “I do.” Fast forward exactly three years, and we found ourselves giddily exploring our way around the Swiss Alps. I am going to do a slight humble brag here and mention that we have now officially seen the Alps in every one of the eight countries that they stretch through. I can tell you right now that they take your breath away no matter what country you are looking at them in. This was our second trip into Switzerland. The first trip was in January of 2019, when we visited the other side of the Swiss Alps in Zermatt to see the Matterhorn. We saw Switzerland when it was a giant snow globe of magic, but this time we wanted to see Switzerland with the cow bells clanging and grass as green as Tiger Woods’ Masters jackets. Luckily for us, the weather decided to cooperate for the majority of the trip. While we got soaked once or twice in torrential downpours, overall the sunny weather added to the backdrop of mountains that absolutely needed zero help being beautiful. This sunny weather may have also contributed to rather uncomfortable sunburns on our legs, but that is neither here nor there. <a href="../blog/switzerlandanniversarytrip.html"><b>(Continue Reading)</b></a></p></div>

	<div class="values">
	<p>As Hall of Famer Bill Veeck Jr. once said, "There are only two seasons: winter and baseball,” and we have been stuck in winter for three extra months too long. By God’s good grace, baseball is returning, in addition to the NBA, MLS, and possibly the NHL by the end of July. When you zoom out and look at the big picture of COVID-19, losing sports is the most miniscule, unimportant, and inconsequential thing. That being said, the excitement for getting back my childhood love back is palpable. There are very few things in this life that take me to a happier place than sitting down, having a beer, and watching a Cubs game.  <a href="../blog/julyreadinglist.html"><b>(Continue Reading)</b></a></p></div>

	<h2><a href="junereadinglist.html">The 3 Books to Read in June: Igniting Change Edition</a></h2>
	<div class="values">
	<p>June’s reading list is a little later in the month than May’s, but I hope you are still looking for a few more reads to round out your month! Before I get to what you should be reading this month, I wanted to share my thoughts about what has been going on in America. Since posting about May’s reading list, America has been turned upside down a bit. In my <a href="blog/mayreadinglist.html"><i>What to Read in May</i></a> post, I recommended the book <i>Just Mercy</i>. At the time of the writing I just thought that it was one of the better books I had come across in the last year, so I decided to put it on the first edition of what is more or less my extended reading list. Little did I know that about 20 days later the United States would see one of the biggest movements for civil rights in recent memory. If you haven’t read the book yet, I recommend it once again. It is one of the most successful books at opening your eyes to the systematic racism that African American’s endure on a daily basis. If you have a problem with the riots, if you have a problem with the protests, if you have a problem with how they are protesting whatsoever, you need to educate. Enough has been enough for a while now, but people have not been listening. Listen to what African American leaders have to say, assist them with calling out the complacency in local law enforcement and local/state/federal governments. Be an ally right now and be on the right side of generational change for society. At the end of the day, I hope I can leave you to think with this sentiment at the very least: <a href="junereadinglist.html"><b>(Continue Reading)</b></a></p></div>

	<h2><a href="mayreadinglist.html">The 3 Books to Read in May: Quarantine Edition</a></h2>
	<div class="values">
	<p>This is the inaugural version of “The 3 Books to Read in ______.” At the beginning of each month I intend to put out a reading list of sorts, to share some of the good books I have been reading lately. Quarantining appears to be slightly dissipating, but nonetheless it would be smart if we continued to do our best and stay inside when possible. One of the best indoor activities, besides puzzling, is sitting down with a good book. Reading a book can take you to an entirely different world, and most importantly it can help distract you from everything that is going on in the world right now. I love to learn about new things, or about different people’s lives, so I tend to read mostly non-fiction books exclusively. Knowing that, most of the books on my list of monthly reads will be non-fiction. I like to think there is a good amount of variation in the kind of non-fiction titles to keep things interesting. Every now and then, I may have my wife suggest some books she has been reading, because she tends to have a nice variety of non-fiction and fiction reads. Without further ado, the following titles are what I recommend in May. I hope you enjoy! <a href="mayreadinglist.html"><b>(Continue Reading)</b></a></p></div>
