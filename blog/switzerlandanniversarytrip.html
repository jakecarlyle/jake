<h1> Third Anniversary in the Swiss Alps </h1>
<h2 style="font-size:17px;"> From getting sunburnt on our wedding day on a beach in Michigan, to being sunburnt in the Swiss alps on our three-year anniversary. Some things never change. </h2>

<p>On July 22, 2017 my wife and I were standing on a beach in St. Joseph, Michigan saying “I do.” Fast forward exactly three years, and we found ourselves giddily exploring our way around the Swiss Alps. I am going to do a slight humble brag here and mention that we have now officially seen the Alps in every one of the eight countries that they stretch through. I can tell you right now that they take your breath away no matter what country you are looking at them in. This was our second trip into Switzerland. The first trip was in January of 2019, when we visited the other side of the Swiss Alps in Zermatt to see the Matterhorn. We saw Switzerland when it was a giant snow globe of magic, but this time we wanted to see Switzerland with the cow bells clanging and grass as green as Tiger Woods’ Masters jackets. Luckily for us, the weather decided to cooperate for the majority of the trip. While we got soaked once or twice in torrential downpours, overall the sunny weather added to the backdrop of mountains that absolutely needed zero help being beautiful. This sunny weather may have also contributed to rather uncomfortable sunburns on our legs, but that is neither here nor there. </p>

<p>Due to COVID-19 this was our first getaway since March, and as much as I love our apartment in Maastricht, it felt great to get out into some nature and see some elevation. To make this a totally stress-free trip, we decided to rent a car for the seven-hour journey to our hotel in Grindelwald. When the rental agency called the evening prior to our departure and told us our BMW would be ready in the morning, I was giddy. At the three- or four-hour mark in any road trip I generally start to get a little bored, and driving becomes a chore. As someone who has an appreciation for luxury vehicles, I knew I wouldn’t spend a second of this journey indifferent towards driving. Against my better judgement I didn’t spend a second of our journey on the autobahn in “sport” mode, but you would be crazy if you thought I didn’t spend the majority of our journey hovering around 100-105 MPH consistently. The highest speed I reached was 125 MPH (a nice even 200 KMPH on the speedometer) to which Katie replied, “did you get it out of your system?” The joy of being able to drive a brand-new BMW down the autobahn was amplified by the addition of some good old American road trip snacks. Katie and I are no strangers to extensive road trips, and the essential pin that holds our road trips together is the road trip snacks that we devour along the way. Luckily the night before we left for this trip, we got a package in the mail from my sister that included Watermelon Sour Patch Kids, a bag of Sweet and Salty Boom Chicka Pop popcorn, and good old Swedish Fish. Literally all of our favorite road trip snacks in one box, added to finding out we were taking a BMW, morale was sky high. </p>

<p>Luckily the drive to Grindelwald largely went without any curveballs, and we got to enjoy the beautiful scenery along the way. Once we drove about 45 minutes past Basel, that is when Switzerland’s natural beauty started to show itself. Add another 30 minutes to that and we were greeted by the west end of Lake Thun and our first views of the Alps. Once we reached the outskirts of Interlaken, that’s when we began the gradual drive up into Grindelwald. Unfortunately, it was a bit of a dreary evening, so the views weren’t revealing their true beauty, but man were they still ridiculous. We pulled into a parking space next to our hotel and scurried into the lobby to avoid being pelted by the hail and drenched by the cold rain that was relentlessly pouring down. We decided to stay at <a href="https://www.hotel-belair.ch/en/home/" target="_blank"> Hotel Bel-Air Eden </a>in “Double Room with Balcony.” After doing a few nights of research, we came to the conclusion that this place offered one of the best values in the city. The price averaged out to be about $150 a night, which is very good in this area, and that price also included breakfast. There were cheaper hotels in the area, but we thoroughly enjoy having a balcony with a view, so that justified paying a little bit more. This was our anniversary trip after all! After admiring the incredible view outside on our balcony, and allowing the rain to dissipate a bit, we decided to go get dinner out on the town. Last time we visited Switzerland we indulged in cheese fondue, and it was delicious. We decided to dive right in on night one and see if we could replicate the great fondue experience we had in Zermatt. We checked some reviews and ended up at <a href="https://www.eiger-grindelwald.ch/essen-trinken/memory/” target="_blank"> Bistro Memory </a>, about a five-minute walk from our hotel. Unfortunately, while the food was just fine, the great fondue experience from Zermatt wasn’t quite replicated. The fondue was just meh, and the noodles we had were also pretty meh. Once you cross into Switzerland’s borders, you may as well just take out a second mortgage on your house. Even for average food you are going to pay through the nose, which is tough to swallow for a guy like myself who loves to find a cheap, hole in the wall for dinner. Fortunately, the bright spot was having a beer from <a href="https://www.haarigekuhbrauerei.ch/” target="_blank"> Haarige Kuh Brauerei </a>in Interlaken. If you happen to come across them while in Switzerland, I highly recommend the Kama Citra pale ale. The next morning, we indulged in a nice hotel breakfast and headed to the <a href="https://www.jungfrau.ch/en-gb/grindelwaldfirst/” target="_blank"> Grindelwald to First lift </a> about 10 minutes walking from our hotel. The entirety of this journey up, and around First, was really a highlight of the trip. There are a few stops in between Grindelwald and First that offer different activities, but we decided to take the lift all the way to the top and work our way down later in the afternoon. Once we got to the top of the lift, we headed to the First Cliff Walk and were absolutely blown away by a panoramic view of the Alps. As far as you can look left and right, you can see snow-capped mountains and beauty that is honestly indescribable. Fewer things make me feel more alive than seeing natural beauty. I have been lucky enough to see some truly beautiful scenery in Europe, but the Alps will leave me in awe every single time without fail. Being the astute travelers we have become, we got up to First very early before the crowds did, so we got to enjoy the cliff walk, and the hike to Bachalpsee in relative peace. The hike to Bachalpsee is about an hour, and after the first 20 minutes or so uphill, it is mostly just a beautiful walk to a beautiful alpine lake. There are some benches around the lake to sit down and enjoy the views and have a snack before you either continue on the path or turn around to First. We headed back to First and enjoyed a drink on the restaurant terrace overlooking the valley and the mountain range. If you ever have a chance to just sit and enjoy a drink while soaking in the views, you have to take it. I mentioned before that there are a few different activities you can do at different stops on the way up to First, but the only one we decided to do was the First Flyer. First Flyer is a zipline that takes you down to the next stop on the cable car route. If you’re going to also pick one activity to do, make it the First Flyer. In total you’re up in the zipline for about two or three minutes, but it is freaking awesome. Talk about feeling absolutely alive. After spending the day on top of First we headed back down to Grindelwald, found some cheap takeout pizza at <a href=”https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g188080-d13930119-Reviews-Tea_n_TakeAway-Grindelwald_Jungfrau_Region_Bernese_Oberland_Canton_of_Bern.html” target="_blank"> Tea n Take Away </a>, and enjoyed a bottle (or two) of wine on our hotel room balcony talking about how great our first three years of marriage have been, and reminiscing about how lucky we are. When you talk about ideal days, this is up there for me. </p>
