<h1> Third Anniversary in the Swiss Alps </h1>
<h2 style="font-size:17px;"> From getting sunburnt on our wedding day on a beach in Michigan, to being sunburnt in the Swiss alps on our three-year anniversary. Some things never change. </h2>

<p>On July 22, 2017 my wife and I were standing on a beach in St. Joseph, Michigan saying “I do.” Fast forward exactly three years, and we found ourselves giddily exploring our way around the Swiss Alps. I am going to do a slight humble brag here and mention that we have now officially seen the Alps in every one of the eight countries that they stretch through. I can tell you right now that they take your breath away no matter what country you are looking at them in. This was our second trip into Switzerland. The first trip was in January of 2019, when we visited the other side of the Swiss Alps in Zermatt to see the Matterhorn. We saw Switzerland when it was a giant snow globe of magic, but this time we wanted to see Switzerland with the cow bells clanging and grass as green as Tiger Woods’ Masters jackets. Luckily for us, the weather decided to cooperate for the majority of the trip. While we got soaked once or twice in torrential downpours, overall the sunny weather added to the backdrop of mountains that absolutely needed zero help being beautiful. This sunny weather may have also contributed to rather uncomfortable sunburns on our legs, but that is neither here nor there. </p>
