<h1> Third Anniversary in the Swiss Alps </h1>
<h2 style="font-size:17px;"> From getting sunburnt on our wedding day on a beach in Michigan, to being sunburnt in the Swiss alps on our three-year anniversary. Some things never change. </h2>

<p>On July 22, 2017 my wife and I were standing on a beach in St. Joseph, Michigan saying “I do.” Fast forward exactly three years, and we found ourselves giddily exploring our way around the Swiss Alps. I am going to do a slight humble brag here and mention that we have now officially seen the Alps in every one of the eight countries that they stretch through. I can tell you right now that they take your breath away no matter what country you are looking at them in. This was our second trip into Switzerland. The first trip was in January of 2019, when we visited the other side of the Swiss Alps in Zermatt to see the Matterhorn. We saw Switzerland when it was a giant snow globe of magic, but this time we wanted to see Switzerland with the cow bells clanging and grass as green as Tiger Woods’ Masters jackets. Luckily for us, the weather decided to cooperate for the majority of the trip. While we got soaked once or twice in torrential downpours, overall the sunny weather added to the backdrop of mountains that absolutely needed zero help being beautiful. This sunny weather may have also contributed to rather uncomfortable sunburns on our legs, but that is neither here nor there. </p>

<p>Due to COVID-19 this was our first getaway since March, and as much as I love our apartment in Maastricht, it felt great to get out into some nature and see some elevation. To make this a totally stress-free trip, we decided to rent a car for the seven-hour journey to our hotel in Grindelwald. When the rental agency called the evening prior to our departure and told us our BMW would be ready in the morning, I was giddy. At the three- or four-hour mark in any road trip I generally start to get a little bored, and driving becomes a chore. As someone who has an appreciation for luxury vehicles, I knew I wouldn’t spend a second of this journey indifferent towards driving. Against my better judgement I didn’t spend a second of our journey on the autobahn in “sport” mode, but you would be crazy if you thought I didn’t spend the majority of our journey hovering around 100-105 MPH consistently. The highest speed I reached was 125 MPH (a nice even 200 KMPH on the speedometer) to which Katie replied, “did you get it out of your system?” The joy of being able to drive a brand-new BMW down the autobahn was amplified by the addition of some good old American road trip snacks. Katie and I are no strangers to extensive road trips, and the essential pin that holds our road trips together is the road trip snacks that we devour along the way. Luckily the night before we left for this trip, we got a package in the mail from my sister that included Watermelon Sour Patch Kids, a bag of Sweet and Salty Boom Chicka Pop popcorn, and good old Swedish Fish. Literally all of our favorite road trip snacks in one box, added to finding out we were taking a BMW, morale was sky high. </p>
