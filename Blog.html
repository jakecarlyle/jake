	<div class="values">
	<p>Welcome back, it’s been a while! While I apologize for my absence in posts, it turns out that planning and executing a transatlantic move, with two pets no less, is infinitely more of a task to take on than I had prepared for. While my wife was a badass and took care of most of it, it still required a lot of teamwork. Thankfully, we have made it to Oklahoma City, and boy have we hit the ground running. I want to begin by saying that leaving Europe was much, much harder than I thought it would be. For what was a pretty up and down experience for myself, I truly didn’t think I would be so sad and emotional leaving our apartment and our city. Maastricht was truly the best possible place we could have spent the last 3 years, and I will forever recommend it to anybody who will listen. I cannot wait to take our future children there, show them where we lived, and relive the memories.  <a href="blog/decemberreadinglist.html"><b>(Continue Reading)</b></a></p></div>

	<div class="values">
	<p>Since I’m sure nearly everyone has gotten through the 10 episodes of Netflix’s new masterpiece, Emily in Paris, I figured now would be a good time to share my experiences in the baguette capital of the world. I’ve been lucky enough to have the opportunity to travel to Paris on two separate occasions, and I had two different experiences each time that I went. The prevailing theme of both trips to Paris was that it really does live up to the dream-like expectations that movies and television shows give it. There is an energy and aura about the city that sucks you into its romanticism. It’s inescapable, and you end up really loving every second of it. There’s a reason that there are so many quotes and stories from famous artists such as Hemingway, Wilde, Fitzgerald, and the like, about how Paris provides inspiration like no other place in the world can. One must visit Paris to truly understand the feelings that this city can provoke inside a person.<a href="blog/jakeinparis.html"><b>(Continue Reading)</b></a></p></div>

	<h2><a href="blog/weekendinthealgarve.html">A Weekend in the Algarve (Poritmão, Portugal)</a></h2>
	<div class="values">
	<p>Summer tourism in Europe has really taken a hit because of COVID-19. In late May/early June, things were trending in a good direction, and there was a strong marketing effort to “Reopen Europe” by high tourist season in July. This marketing effort was largely successful, until people actually started to travel again, and cases began to spike in popular tourist regions. That being said, some countries have definitely had better luck in welcoming tourists than others. Portugal is one of those countries that has had a very successful time reopening to tourists. The Department of Tourism for Portugal (Tourismo de Portugal) launched the “Clean and Safe” campaign with the goal of encouraging tourists to return to Portuguese hotspots like Lisbon, Faro, Portimão, and Porto. This initiative has been largely successful to date and gives tourists an extra layer of comfortability booking a hotel that has the “seal of approval” in terms of cleanliness from an official branch of the Portuguese government. Katie and I decided to take advantage of these extensive efforts and booked a weekend sipping wine on an ocean view balcony and laying on some of the most beautiful beaches in Europe. With the beginning of the planning for our transatlantic move looming, we wanted to get one last getaway to reach maximum levels or relaxation before things went to chaos. <a href="blog/weekendinthealgarve.html"><b>(Continue Reading)</b></a></p></div>

	<h2><a href="blog/octoberreadinglist.html">The 3 Books to Read in October</a></h2>
	<div class="values">
	<p>The “3 to Read” series took a little bit of a break the last two months, but we are back in business with 3 new books to enjoy this October. The last couple of months have been a pretty hectic time in our life. Who knew planning a transatlantic move, with pets, in the middle of a global pandemic would be such a logistical nightmare? Luckily, at the time of writing this post, most fires have been put out, and our move is looking like it will happen as smoothly as you could expect in today’s current environment. Beyond planning for this crazy move, we have managed to take two much needed getaways to Portugal (post coming soon!) and Paris. Laying on a beach in the Algarve and sipping wine and eating a baguette in the park in front of the Eifel Tower can have a therapeutic effect on a person. Unfortunately, due to the circumstances that accompany this pandemic, it looks like our European adventures have come to a close. Thankfully, it will take years for me to run out of places, countries, and trips that we have taken before I run out of things to write about. So, fear not, you can continue to live vicariously through my travels on this website for years to come. <a href="blog/octoberreadinglist.html"><b>(Continue Reading)</b></a></p></div>

	<div class="values">
	<p>This is a particularly difficult post to write, but it is one that I know my dad would be happy and so excited that I did. In May of this year my dad passed away. I’m writing this in September, and I can say it has four of the most difficult months of my life. He didn’t even get to see all the work that I put into this website, and the finished product; it’s something I know he would’ve been very proud of me for. Now, this post isn’t entirely about that, that is an entire post in itself, but this post is about one of my favorite memories that I have of my dad. Every year since I can remember my dad usually fired up the crockpot and made this dip for the opening weekend of the NFL, and usually the Super Bowl. When my brother or I think of football, our minds usually drifts to this dip. The NFL kicks off this weekend, so I thought I would honor my dad and share the recipe of this dip that means so much to my brother and me.<a href="blog/DadsGamedayDip.html"><b>(Continue Reading)</b></a></p></div>

	<h2><a href="blog/2020fantasyfootballrankings.html">2020 Fantasy Football Rankings and Insights (0.5 PPR)(Updated 9/5)</a></h2>
	<div class="values">
<p>This previous Spring, I had the idea to start my own fantasy football brand. I’m confident in my social media knowhow to springboard a brand from nothing to something that people seek out. I’m also extremely confident in my knowledge of the NFL to give sound advice that people can trust. While some personal events got in the way of my desire and motivation to start that up this spring and summer, it is still in my future plans of something I would like to do. I have had quite a high level of success in fantasy football over the 15 or so years that I have been playing, and I want to share some of the knowledge with people that want to get better. Drafting preparation season is upon us, so I thought it would be a good time to drop my rankings. This is hobby of mine that I like to take on in the fall, so in lieu of starting my own fantasy football website this summer there may be some blog posts on here instead. Always feel free to reach out if you ever have any questions or requests. <a href="blog/2020fantasyfootballrankings.html"><b>(Continue Reading)</b></a></p></div>
